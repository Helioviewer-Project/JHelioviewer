 * Interface be enable a class to draw to the screen.

 * <p>
 * By implementing this interface, a class is able to draw geometric figures and
 * images onto the main image. Therefore, it also has to register itself with
 * the component responsible for drawing the main image (e.g. by calling
 * {@link org.helioviewer.jhv.gui.components.BasicImagePanel#addPostRenderer(ScreenRenderer)}
 * ) When drawing the image, the managing component will call this interface,
 * providing a ScreenRenderGraphics object, to allow the implementing class to
 * draw its contents to the screen.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note, that for drawing, the screen coordinate system is used. As base unit,
 * it uses pixels for both axis.
