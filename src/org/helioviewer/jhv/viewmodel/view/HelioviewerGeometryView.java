/**
 * View specially designed to improve the appearance of solar images.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For many kinds of solar images, not every part of the image rectangle
 * contains valid data, since the sun is round. This view is supposed to cut
 * away the unnecessary parts of such solar images (e.g. MDI and LASCO), to
 * improve the overall look of the entire image. This is done by applying a mask
 * the images, which defines the areas which should turn transparent.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Currently, all implementations support to kinds of masks: Disc images, such
 * as MDI and occulter images, such as LASCO.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The information on which parts of the image can be cut be away is read from
 * the image meta data. Apart from that, the borders are moved a little bit to
 * get a clearer image, on cost of cutting away some of the actual image data.
 * This is behavior is desired, since the border areas of such images do not
 * contain any important data.
