/**
 * Basic interface for every view.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A view represents an knot within the view chain. The view chain is a tree of
 * multiple views, usually with a {@link ComponentView} as a root and several
 * {@link ImageInfoView}s as leafs. Along every path through the view chain, the
 * image data is changed, for example by applying filters (see
 * {@link FilterView}), adding overlays (see {@link OverlayView} or merging
 * several partial images into one resulting image (see {@link LayeredView}. The
 * different views communicate via {@link ViewListener}s.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The design of the view chain is very loose and allows many variations, but
 * there exist one requirement has to hold: After finishing the construction of
 * any view chain, no call to getAdapter for {@link RegionView},
 * {@link ViewportView} or {@link MetaDataView} is allowed to return null, thus
 * every path of the view chain must contain all three views. To ensure that,
 * refer to {@link ImageInfoView} and {@link LayeredView}
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is essential for ever view. It provides functions to add and
 * remove ViewListeners, so that any other class will be informed about changes
 * in this view. Apart from that, it provides a basic mechanism to navigate
 * through the view chain: Calling getAdapter returns the next view within the
 * view chain implementing a desired interface, independent from the number and
 * structure of views in between.
