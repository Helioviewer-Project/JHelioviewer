/**
 * View to merged multiple Views.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The LayeredView a central element of the view chain. It is responsible for
 * displaying multiple views, which are organized as a stack of layers. The
 * basic functionality this includes to add, move and remove layers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When drawing the different layers, the layer with index zero is drawn first,
 * so the stack of layers is drawn in order bottom to top.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The position of the layers in relation to each other is calculated based on
 * their regions. Thus, every view that is connected as a layer must provide a
 * {@link RegionView}. Also, every layer has to provide a {@link MetaDataView}
 * and a {@link ViewportView}. To take care of this requirement, implement the
 * {@link ImageInfoView} as recommended. Since a LayeredView can be used as a
 * layer itself, its implementation also should implement {@link RegionView},
 * {@link ViewportView} and {@link MetaDataView} as well.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As an additional feature, the LayeredView support hiding layers.
