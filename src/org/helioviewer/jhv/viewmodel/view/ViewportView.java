 * View to manage the viewport of the image currently shown.

 * This view manages the viewport, which is currently displayed. By accessing

 * <p>
 * Since the viewport represents a section of the screen or a comparable medium
 * (e.g. an output image), the size of the viewport is always given in pisels.
 *

 * Note, that it is expected to have at least one ViewportView in every path of
 * the view chain. To take care of this requirement, implement the
 * {@link ImageInfoView} as recommended.
