     * This implementation performs checks if the newly added layer fits the
     * rest of the already added layers and notifies the user if he might have
     * made a bad decision.
     * 
     * The basic algorithm works as follows:
     * 
     * - Calulate the total timespan covered by all layers together by taking
     * the date of the earliest frame and the latest frame - Calulate the length
     * of this total timespan - For each layer, calulate the length of it's
     * individual covered timespan - If the ratio between individual timespan
     * and the total timespan is smaller than a given
     * (smallestValidCoverageFraction) value, the algorithm decides that the
     * movies do not overlap nicely
     * 
     * Note:
     * 
     * - The maximum coverage ratio is 1.0, the minimum is 0.0
     * 
     * @see LayerTableOverlapWatcher#SMALLEST_VALID_COVERAGE_FRACTION
     * 
     *      In addition to this, a warning is shown if no timing information is
     *      available for the newly added layer.
