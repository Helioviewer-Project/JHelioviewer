       reusable code refers to the original Kakadu source code, as
       distributed with the license, with or without modifications and
       exclusions.  Reusable code also includes any intermediate compiled
       form, such as dynamically or statically linked libraries, which
       provides means of exploiting the functionality of the Kakadu tools
       in new Applications.
  1.2  Application: Compiled code generated using the Kakadu source code or
       Reusable Code derived from the Kakadu source code, or any part thereof.
       No part of any application is Reusable Code.
  1.3  Licensee: The individual person who has purchased the Kakadu
       software and is granted the non-commercial license under this
       Agreement.
  1.4. Third Party: Any person or legal entity which is not NSi or the
       Licensee.
  1.5  Deployment: Distribution of one or more Applications to a Third Party.

     financial return to the Licensee or any other Third Party which
     further supplies or otherwise uses such Applications.  All copies of
     Applications shall contain notification that they were developed using
     the Kakadu software.
  4. The Licensee shall have the right to distribute Reusable
     Code to a Third Party, provided the Third Party possesses a license
     to use the Kakadu software, and provided such distribution does not
     result in any direct or indirect financial return to the Licensee.
     All copies of such distributed code shall contain all copyright and
     proprietary notices from the original source code.
  5. The Licensee shall have the right to use the Kakadu source code
     indefinitely, subject to the Termination provisions of this agreement.

     to be used, except in accordance with this Agreement.
  7. NSi may terminate the license grant, by written notice to
     Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of the license.
  8. Absent appropriate exemption certificate(s), Licensee shall pay all
     taxes, duties, or customs, except for taxes based on NSi net income.
  9. Licensee shall not use the name, trade names or trademarks of NSi
     or any of its Affiliates in any advertising, promotional literature
     or any other material, whether in written, electronic, or other form,

     NSi, and then solely for purposes of identifying NSi software.
 10. The license is not transferable to a Third Party and may not be
     sub-licensed to any other person.
Limitation of Liability:
 11.  THE KAKADU SOURCE CODE IS A COLLECTION OF SOFTWARE TOOLS, WHICH MAY
      NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE.  NSI DOES NOT WARRANT
      THAT: THE OPERATION OF THE KAKADU SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
      ERROR FREE; THE KAKADU SOFTWARE IS FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE; OR
      THE KAKADU SOFTWARE OR ITS USE DOES NOT INFRINGE THE RIGHTS OF A
      THIRD PARTY.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL WARRANTIES, TERMS
      AND CONDITIONS NOT EXPRESSLY INCLUDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUDED.
      NSI SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS
      (WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR OTHERWISE), AND LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
      BUSINESS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, OR LOSS OF USE OF ANY COMPUTER HARDWARE
      OR SOFTWARE, RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE KAKADU SOFTWARE.

      THE KAKADU SOFTWARE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS THE SOLE BASIS
      TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WHOSE INCORRECT SOLUTION COULD RESULT IN INJURY
      TO PERSON OR PROPERTY.  IF THE SOFTWARE IS EMPLOYED IN SUCH A MANNER,
      IT IS AT THE LICENSEE'S OWN RISK AND NSI EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS
      ALL LIABILITY FOR SUCH MISUSE TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

      NSI'S LIABILITY FOR MATTERS IN RELATION TO WHICH THE LIABILITY BY
      LAW CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED.
      EXCEPT AS AFORESAID, ALL OTHER LIABILITY OF NSI WHETHER IN RELATION TO
      BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT
      IN AGGREGATE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID TO NSI UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
      THE KAKADU SOFTWARE.

      SOME JUSISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
      WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY
      NOT APPLY TO THE LICENSEE.

      WHERE AVAILABLE, NSI'S LIABILITY UNDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE
      IMPLIED BY LAW AND WHICH MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED, IS LIMITED TO, AT NSI'S
      OPTION, RESUPPLY OF THE KAKADU SOFTWARE OR PAYMENT OF THE COSTS OF
      RESUPPLY OF THE KAKADU SOFTWARE.
