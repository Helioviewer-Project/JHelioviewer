Status of version 3
===================
This repository contains the no longer actively developed version 3 of JHelioviewer. Downloads are still available from http://www.jhelioviewer.org/download_archive.html and functional. The project is in maintenance mode and issues are fixed on a best-effort basis.

However, work on JHV version 2 continues. It is hosted at https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/JHelioviewer-SWHV.



What is JHelioviewer?
=====================
JHelioviewer is visualization software for solar image data based on the JPEG 2000 compression standard. JPEG 2000 offers many useful new features and has the potential to revolutionize the way high-resolution image data are disseminated and analyzed. The JPEG 2000 Interactive Protocol (JPIP) enables serving data in a highly compressed, quality-progressive, region-of-interest-based stream. These features minimize the data volume transmitted while maximizing its usability. This is especially relevant for solar physics since NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) has started providing more than a terabyte of image data per day.
